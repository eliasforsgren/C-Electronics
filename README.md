## About the Book

"Practical Electronics for Inventors" by Paul Scherz and Simon Monk is a comprehensive guide for understanding the fundamentals of electronics and applying them in real-world projects. [Get the book here](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Electronics-Inventors-Fourth-Scherz/dp/1259587541).

## Getting Started

To start coding the examples in C, you need to set up a C development environment on your computer. Here are the steps for different operating systems:

### Windows

1. **Install a C Compiler**:
   - Download and install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/). Follow the installation instructions on the website.
   - Alternatively, you can use [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/) which includes a C++ compiler.

2. **Set up Environment Variables** (for MinGW):
   - Add the path to the MinGW `bin` directory to your system's PATH environment variable.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open Command Prompt and type `gcc --version`. You should see the version information of GCC if it is installed correctly.

### Mac

1. **Install Xcode Command Line Tools**:
   - Open Terminal and type:
     ```sh
     xcode-select --install
     ```
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

2. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open Terminal and type `gcc --version` or `clang --version`. You should see the version information of the compiler.

### Linux

1. **Install GCC**:
   - Open Terminal and type:
     ```sh
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install build-essential
     ```
   - For Fedora-based distributions, use:
     ```sh
     sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
     ```

2. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open Terminal and type `gcc --version`. You should see the version information of GCC.

## Code Editors

Here are some popular code editors you can use for writing and editing C code:

- **Visual Studio Code**: [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **CLion**: [Download here](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
- **Eclipse**: [Download here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/)
- **Code::Blocks**: [Download here](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26)
